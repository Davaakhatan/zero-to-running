## Zero-to-Running Developer Environment

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2024  
**Organization**: Wander  
**Project ID**: 3MCcAvCyK7F77BpbXUSI_1762376408364

## Executive Summary

The Zero-to-Running Developer Environment is an innovative solution that revolutionizes how developers set up their local development environments. The goal is to enable new engineers to clone a repository, execute a single command (`make dev`), and instantly have a fully functional multi-service application environment running.

## Problem Statement

Developers face significant delays and frustrations due to:
- Complex and inconsistent local environment setups
- "Works on my machine" problems
- Time spent troubleshooting configuration issues
- Manual dependency management
- Infrastructure setup complexity

## Solution Vision

A single-command developer environment that:
- Automatically provisions all required services
- Handles service dependencies and ordering
- Provides clear feedback during setup
- Supports externalized configuration
- Enables clean teardown

## Target Users

1. **New Developers**: Fresh hires who need to get started quickly
2. **Ops-Savvy Engineers**: Experienced developers seeking streamlined processes

## Success Metrics

- **Setup Time**: Under 10 minutes for new developers
- **Coding Time**: 80%+ time spent writing code vs managing infrastructure
- **Support Reduction**: 90% decrease in environment-related tickets

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, Next.js 16
- **Backend API**: Node.js, Fastify, TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Cache**: Redis
- **Local Development**: Docker Compose (orchestration)
- **Production Deployment**: Kubernetes (k8s) on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) - *Planned*
- **Containerization**: Docker

## Functional Requirements

### P0 (Must-Have)

#### Core Functionality
- Single command (`make dev`) to bring up entire stack
- Externalized configuration
- Secure mock secrets handling
- Inter-service communication (API → DB, API → Cache)
- Health checks for all services
- Single command teardown (`make down`)
- Comprehensive documentation

#### User Interface
- Setup wizard with prerequisites checker
- Service status monitoring dashboard
- Real-time log viewer
- Health check visualization
- Configuration management UI
- Resource usage monitoring
- Service dependency graph

### P1 (Should-Have)

- Automatic service dependency ordering
- Meaningful startup logging
- Developer-friendly defaults (hot reload, debug ports)
- Graceful error handling (port conflicts, missing dependencies)
- Quick actions panel (start/stop/restart services)
- Setup progress tracking

### P2 (Nice-to-Have)

- Multiple environment profiles
- Pre-commit hooks/linting
- Local SSL/HTTPS support
- Database seeding with test data
- Performance optimizations (parallel startup)
- WebSocket support for real-time updates

## User Stories

1. **As a new developer**, I want to clone and run `make dev` so I can start coding immediately
2. **As an ops-savvy engineer**, I want to configure via config file so I can customize my setup
3. **As a developer**, I want clear feedback during setup so I know if everything is working
4. **As a developer**, I want to tear down with one command so I can maintain a clean setup
5. **As a developer**, I want to see service status in real-time so I know what's running
6. **As a developer**, I want to view logs easily so I can debug issues quickly

## User Experience Goals

### Clarity
- Clear feedback at every step
- Meaningful error messages
- Visual status indicators

### Speed
- Fast startup (< 10 minutes)
- Parallel operations where possible
- Efficient resource usage

### Reliability
- Consistent results across machines
- Graceful error handling
- Automatic recovery where possible

### Flexibility
- Configurable without code changes
- Support for different profiles
- Easy customization

## Out of Scope

- Advanced CI/CD pipeline integrations
- Production-level secret management systems
- Comprehensive performance benchmarking
- Multi-cloud deployment automation
- Advanced monitoring and alerting systems

## Acceptance Criteria

### Setup Command
- ✅ `make dev` successfully starts all services
- ✅ Prerequisites are validated before starting
- ✅ Services start in correct dependency order
- ✅ Health checks confirm all services are running
- ✅ Dashboard is accessible at `http://localhost:3000`

### Teardown Command
- ✅ `make down` stops all services cleanly
- ✅ Resources are properly cleaned up
- ✅ No orphaned containers or processes

### Configuration
- ✅ Configuration can be externalized to `config/dev.yaml`
- ✅ Secrets are handled securely (mock pattern)
- ✅ Configuration changes don't require code changes

### Monitoring
- ✅ All services show status in dashboard
- ✅ Health checks are visible and accurate
- ✅ Logs are aggregated and viewable
- ✅ Resource usage is displayed

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Docker Desktop
- kubectl (Kubernetes CLI)
- Azure CLI (for AKS access)
- Node.js (v18+)
- pnpm (package manager)
- Make

### Infrastructure Dependencies
- Kubernetes cluster (AKS or local)
- Docker runtime
- Sufficient system resources

## Constraints

- Must work on macOS, Linux, and Windows (via WSL)
- Must support local development (minikube/kind)
- Must support cloud deployment (AKS)
- Must complete setup in under 10 minutes
- Must use externalized configuration

## Risks & Mitigations

### High Risk
- **Backend Framework**: "Dora" framework doesn't exist
  - **Mitigation**: Use Fastify (modern, TypeScript-friendly)

### Medium Risk
- **AKS Access**: May need local K8s alternative
  - **Mitigation**: Support both AKS and local K8s (minikube/kind)

### Low Risk
- **Configuration Complexity**: May need iterative refinement
  - **Mitigation**: Start simple, iterate based on feedback

## Success Indicators

- New developers productive within first hour
- Zero environment-related support tickets
- Consistent experience across team members
- Positive developer feedback on onboarding process
- Setup time consistently under 10 minutes
